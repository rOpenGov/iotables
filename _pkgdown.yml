     An overview of the reproducible workflow of **importing data**, preparing important analytical
       objects for input-output equations, and solving matrix equations. A re-creation of the examples of the
       Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables by Joerg Beutel.

     These data wrangling functions take out from the longform raw data files the inportant matrixes of 
     of input-output economics. The coefficient matrixes are strictly labelled, ordered, and they are successfully
     symmetric (apart from the auxiliary key column.)

     These data wrangling functions create vectors that conform the matrix, i.e. their elements are 
     stricly labelled and ordered.

     The *multiplier_create* is a wrapper function around *equation_solve* to create multipliers. 
     The *input_multipliers_create* and *output_multipliers_create* create the most frequently used 
     multipliers.

  - title: "Linkages"
    desc: >
     In the framework of input-output analysis, production by a particular sector has two kinds of effects
     on other sectors in the economy. If a sector increases its output, more inputs (purchases) are required
     from other sectors (**backward linkage**). The increased output of this sector indicates that additional
     amounts of products are available to be used as inputs by other sectors which can increase their 
     production (**forward linkage**). See the *Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables* p506-507.
