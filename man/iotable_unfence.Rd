\title{Remove Q1 fence totals before matrix algebra}
\usage{
iotable_unfence(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A stacked SIOT tibble made by \code{iotable_create_stacked()}.}
}
\value{
The same tibble without the fence row/column (if present).
}
\description{
Drop the optional Q1 total row/column that fence Quadrant 1, using
labels stored by \code{iotable_create_stacked()}. If labels are not found,
the input is returned unchanged.
}
\examples{
x <- iotable_create_stacked(q1, q2, q3, ids, fin, pri, fence_q1 = TRUE)
x2 <- iotable_unfence(x) # safe to feed into matrix equations
}
