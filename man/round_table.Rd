\title{Systematically round numeric values in a table}
\usage{
round_table(data_table, digits = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_table}{A symmetric inputâ€“output table, a use table, a supply
table, or a margins/taxes table. Must be a data frame or tibble.}

\item{digits}{Integer scalar giving the number of digits for rounding.
If \code{NULL}, no rounding is performed. If not numeric, a warning is
issued and the table is returned unchanged.}
}
\value{
A tibble (if input was a tibble) or data frame with numeric
columns rounded according to \code{digits}. Non-numeric columns are
unchanged. If \code{digits = NULL} or invalid, the table is returned
unchanged.
}
\description{
Utility function to round all numeric columns in an input-output style
table. It is mainly intended for reproducibility and comparability with
external sources that report rounded values. Non-numeric columns are left
unchanged.

Special cases:
\itemize{
\item If \code{digits = NULL} (default), the function returns the input unchanged
(no rounding).
\item Values exactly equal to \code{1e-06} are preserved to avoid suppressing small
"epsilon" entries that occur in published IOTs and SUTs.
}
}
\details{
Rounding conventions in published tables differ across sources:
\itemize{
\item Eurostat (2008, \emph{Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables}),
presents benchmark IOTs rounded to integers (millions of EUR).
\item UN (2018, \emph{Handbook on SUTs and IOTs}), notes that examples may not
sum exactly because of rounding (p. 15).
}

This function allows the user to replicate such rounded presentations
while keeping analytic pipelines consistent. Internally, rounding should
be used with care: repeated rounding in intermediate steps may accumulate
error. For modelling, keep \code{digits = NULL} and apply rounding only when
reproducing published sources.
